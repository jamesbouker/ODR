We did not implement:

- Multiple clients on a single node
- Multiple Servers on a single node
- Server and Client running on the same node
- Staleness

*Ports are passed to and from client and sever but are not mapped to sun_path's - hence only one client allowed per node





Worth Mentioning:

- The Makefile has my user account hardcoded
